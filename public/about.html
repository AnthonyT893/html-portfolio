<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Anthony.</p> 
  <p>A little bit about my professional experience, I've previously worked in the hospitality industry for many years.
  It wasn't until the outbreak of COVID-19 is where I had a massive wakeup call and decided on a career change into the tech industry. 
  I've always had an interest in technology and I figured it was time to pursue this field even though I had no experience.
  </p>

  <p>Luckily, my first role in the tech industry was as a customer support specialist at a accounts payable software company.
  I've gained a lot of experience at the company and after a year, I transitioned into a technical support specialist role at a travel tech company. 
  The reason I decided to work at this company was they offered a Work From Anywhere policy for 3 months every year. This perk allowed me to travel overseas and work remotely.
  </p> 
  <p>After 3 years with the company, I've decided to pursue studying full-time as a software developer. I'm currently a student at The App Brewery learning web development. 
  I'm excited to learn more about web development and to build my portfolio. I'm looking forward to working on projects and collaborating with others. 
  I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
  </p>

  <p>
  On a personal note, I'm a huge video game, movie and music enthusiast. To balance out my sedentary hobbies, I enjoy going out social dancing at 
  latin dance events and I'm also a foodie. I love trying out new foods and I'm always on the lookout for new restaurants or street food to try, which is the reason why 
  I left Australia on December 2024 and moved to Thailand. Hit me up if you want if you want to learn how to dance or if you want to try out some new foods.
